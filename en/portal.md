After logging into Portal, you get to an overview page, which lists organizations (1), sites (2),
and units (3) that you have granted access to.

Organizations that the user administers have the option for managing user and identifiers enabled
(4).

On the level of sites, there is an indicator of the alarm state for the entire site as either
`armed`, `disarmed`, or `partial`. Users that have been granted the corresponding permission change
the alarm state for the entire site (i.e., for all the units) by clicking on the indicator. In
addition, an administrator has the option to manage user permissions for the site (5).

Alarm state indicator is also present for each unit (3) and users with the necessary permission can
also click it arm or disarm the alarm for the single unit. Icons on the bottom of the unit preview
lead to the individual offered services:

- Access
- Alarm
- Weather
- Statistics
- Tracking
- Timelapse

Color of the icon indicates:

- Blue: the service is subscribed and the user has the necesasry site permissions to use it.
- Red: the service is subscribed, but the user lacks the necesasry site permissions to use it.
- Grey: the service is not subscribed.
