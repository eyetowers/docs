# Frequently Asked Questions

## I have a new user account. Why do I not see any sites in Portal?

Mostl likely you miss user permissions to a site or sites. Contact your admin to grant you the
required [permissions](/en/portal.md#user-permissions).

## Why I cannot enable PTZ controls on some of the cameras?

Not all cameras support PTZ. Some can rotate but not zoom and vice versa and some are static
altogather. To double check capabilities of a camera, try finding its data sheet on the internet
using its model name displayed after hovering over the camera name in the camera view header.
