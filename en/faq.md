# Frequently Asked Questions

## I have a new user account. Why do I not see any sites in Portal?

Mostl likely you miss user permissions to a site or sites. Contact your admin to grant you the
required [permissions](/en/portal.md#user-permissions).

## Why I cannot enable PTZ controls on some of the cameras?

Not all cameras support PTZ. Some can rotate but not zoom and vice versa and some are static
altogather. To double check capabilities of a camera, try finding its data sheet on the internet
using its model name displayed after hovering over the camera name in the camera view header.

## I want EyeTowers to delete all data from/about my user account.

Your account can be deleted by the administrator of your organization through the web
[Portal](portal.eyetowers.io/portal/). If your organization is managed by EyeTowers or you represent
your organization and want us to delete all data and records related to it, please contact our
